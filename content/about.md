## Hello, I'm Jacob!

I'm a non-binary and queer individual with a background in conservation, tech, and service. I'm using my experience to make our physical and digital worlds a kinder, safer, lovelier, and more accessible place. My creative pursuits include photography and poetry.

My pronouns are they/them, and I am located in Philadelphia, PA. Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:jacobtl@proton.me). Thanks for visiting!
